# Week 07 - Writing our document, polishing and testing our level
Today we will be polishing and testing our level ready for submission at the end of this week

## Tools used
Today's task uses (but is not limited to):

* Github Desktop (or your Github client of choice)
* Unity
* Visual Studio Code or another text editor for your document

## Assignment deliverable
Today you will be working on finishing up your assignment: doing some final week edits to your level, and organising your documentation.

Depending on where you are up to, you might want to start at a different stage here. You may also be running a bit behind, and find it useful to spend time on Week 5 or 6 tasks. This is about what you can do to get your assignment ready for submission. If you are unsure, call over your teacher and have a chat.

## Reviewing your level (30 min)
Now that you have a completed level, spend some time reviewing it's design. A portion of this can be done by simply panning/looking through the level, but will generally require playing through it. A few questions to ask yourself as you play through your level:

### Theme and Practicality
* What kind of platformer have you made? Is it action, puzzle, precision, etc.? Something else? Does the game have a clear "theme" in terms of gameplay and challenge type? If not, can you make this more cohesive?
* The spec called for the first section of the game to introduce the player to all the main mechanics. Is this true? Is there anything left out that should be added in? If so, how will you do it?
* Does the level "end"? Did you put in the keys and an end door?
* Does the level's difficulty conform to the assignment spec? Does it take approximately 5-6 minutes to play?
* Did you create your entire level in 1 scene, and is it named "Main"? Is there any ambiguity for your marker as to what scene to mark?

### Experience Goals
* How is Discovery facilitated? Is the player given safe opportunities to experiment with mechanics before being challenged with them?
* What is the dramatic pacing of the level? Can you map out each encounter's intensity, and is there good modulation? If not, how would you fix it?
* Does the level challenge reflexes and problem-solving? How? Is challenge properly scaffolded and supported via the dramatic arc?
* Is the play enouraged to explore via non-linearity? Where coudl you add some polish effects and scenary to help with this?

If asking any of these questions prompt redesign, then carry that out now. This may involve the creation of new prototyping artefacts, or at this stage you may be able to just make these changes in the scene itself. Make sure you note down these changes so you can discuss them in your design doc.

## Next Week
Next week, we will be moving on from Unity and looking at the tools used in the final assignment for this unit.
