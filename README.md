# Week 07 - Writing our document, polishing and testing our level
Today we will be polishing and testing our level ready for submission at the end of this week

## Tools used
Today's task uses (but is not limited to):

* GitHub Desktop (or your GitHub client of choice)
* Unity
* Visual Studio Code or another text editor for your document

## Assignment deliverable
Today you will be working on finishing up your assignment: doing some final week edits to your level, and organising your documentation.

Depending on where you are up to, you might want to start at a different stage here. You may also be running a bit behind, and find it useful to spend time on Week 5 or 6 tasks. This is about what you can do to get your assignment ready for submission. For this reason, I have removed timings from this prac, but the intention is you'll spend about equal time on each of these tasks. If you are unsure, call over your teacher and have a chat.

## Reviewing your level
Now that you have a completed level, spend some time reviewing its design. A portion of this can be done by simply panning/looking through the level, but will generally require playing through it. A few questions to ask yourself as you play through your level:

### Theme and Practicality
* What kind of platformer have you made? Is it action, puzzle, precision, etc.? Something else? Does the game have a clear "theme" in terms of gameplay and challenge type? If not, can you make this more cohesive?
* The spec called for the first section of the game to introduce the player to all the main mechanics. Is this true? Is there anything left out that should be added in? If so, how will you do it?
* Does the level "end"? Did you put in the keys and an end door?
* Does the level's difficulty conform to the assignment spec? Does it take approximately 5-6 minutes to play?
* Did you create your entire level in 1 scene, and is it named "Main"? Is there any ambiguity for your marker as to what scene to mark?

### Experience Goals
* How is Discovery facilitated? Is the player given safe opportunities to experiment with mechanics before being challenged with them?
* What is the dramatic pacing of the level? Can you map out each encounter's intensity, and is there good modulation? If not, how would you fix it?
* Does the level challenge reflexes and problem-solving? How? Is challenge properly scaffolded and supported via the dramatic arc?
* Is the play encouraged to explore via non-linearity? Where could you add some polish effects and scenery to help with this?

If asking any of these questions prompt redesign, then carry that out now. This may involve the creation of new prototyping artefacts, or at this stage you may be able to just make these changes in the scene itself. Make sure you note down these changes so you can discuss them in your design doc.

## Polish effects and scenery
So far, we've focused exclusively on the level layout and how that supports our experience goals. However, it's also important to think about how certain scenery and polish effects can augment these experience goals and appropriately lead our player through the level.

There's a large variety of scenery images and VFX that you can add to your scene to elaborate on the level's fiction (such as placing a crashed spaceship near the weapon pick-ups) or guide the player forward (such as placing light shafts to indicate the player needs to go up). Have a look in the following folders for images and affects you can add into your scene:

* `Assets > 2DGameKit > Prefabs > VFX > Environment` (for environmental effects)
* `Assets > 2DGameKit > Art > Sprites > Environment` (for non-interactable set-dressings)

Note that this is an exception to our rule about using elements from outside of the prefabs provided to you! Always make sure everything still works with anything you've added in.

You should also at this stage consider if any of your tiles should be re-arranged to better serve visual communication to the player as to where to go - a jump might be possible, for instance, but does the player know it is a jump? How can you better signpost this?

Finally (and this is a big one!) consider the player's view at all times. Can the player clearly see where they need to go on screen, or are things too far apart to be visible when they need to be? Is there too much extra clutter on screen that it makes things difficult for the player?

## Final playtest
Do a final round of playtesting with a peer. Using the questions from the first section of today's prac, provide feedback to your peer on their level. Be thorough, kind, and constructive.

## Organising your documentation
Spend the rest of the lesson getting your documentation together. If you have not yet started on your report, now is a good time to do so, even if you are just answering with dot points for now to flesh out later. Make sure all your forms of prototyping are captured and inside your repo, linked up where relevant in your design doc. If you have been following an iterative design process, you should already have enough artefacts to meet the three prototype minimum threshold, but make sure you are including any additional design artefacts as well - it'd be great to hear about different ways you are prototyping!

Finally, make sure all Generative AI uses are declared and evidenced appropriately.

## After class
You have until the assignment due date to submit. This means after class you still have time to do some work! No matter how far ahead or behind you might feel you are, there's opportunities or improvement or to catch-up. Have a think about what your plan is to get you over the finish line on time. If you have any questions, please reach out to unit staff.

## Next Week
Next week, we will be moving on from Unity and looking at the tools used in the final assignment for this unit.
